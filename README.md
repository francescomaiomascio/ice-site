# site

Personal hub and public proof surface.

This repository powers **maiomascio.dev**: a stable, readable entry point that maps my work across GitHub, Medium, and product artifacts—without turning the website into a “project homepage” for any single repo.

The goal is simple: make the work navigable.

---

## What this site is

- A public interface for **systems work**: identity, authority, traceability, execution structure.
- A curated index of projects, writing series, and artifacts.
- A long-lived surface that provides context and routing (not hype).

---

## What this site is not

- Not a blog platform (publishing happens on Medium).
- Not a product platform (sales happen on Gumroad).
- Not an “ICE control panel” (ICE remains defined by its own repos).
- No backend, no accounts, no tracking-driven UX assumptions.

---

## Primary entry points

(Links are intentionally explicit: the website routes; the canonical content lives on those platforms.)
