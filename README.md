ICE Website is the **web presence** of the ICE ecosystem.

This repository hosts a Next.js–based website used to present ICE concepts,
project information, and early documentation links.  
The current structure reflects an **early and transitional phase** of the
project.

A redesign and restructuring are expected as the ICE ecosystem matures.

---

## Purpose

ICE Website exists to:

- Provide a public web entry point for ICE
- Host high-level project pages (about, status, download, docs)
- Experiment with visual identity and layout
- Serve as a placeholder for future web presence

This repository does **not** represent the final ICE website.

---

## Scope

Current and experimental areas include:

- Next.js application structure
- Static informational pages
- Theme and styling integration
- Early branding and layout experiments
- Temporary documentation routing

The structure is subject to significant change.

---

## Design Notes

- The site is considered legacy and transitional
- Content and routing may change without notice
- Styling and theming are shared with early ICE assets
- No stability or long-term guarantees are provided

This repository prioritizes **continuity over polish**.

---

## Usage

ICE Website is intended for **public visibility**, not for application logic.

It may reference:
- ICE Docs
- ICE Studio
- ICE repositories and assets

Deployment strategy and hosting are expected to evolve.

---

## Status

This project is in a **legacy / placeholder state**.
A future redesign is planned.
